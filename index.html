Dee Sy Nerr -
Dee is a new designer for a small toy company. She has a bachelor's degree in design, and applied for an open position at the company.
She spends her time coming up with new ideas for toys, designing a cad model for them, and producing a test copy, then going back to step one.
She is growing tired of redesigning the bases for ideas over and over again.
